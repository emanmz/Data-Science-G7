How to github 101 
1. git clone (url) (YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THIS ONCE)

2. cd to the project
3. edit stuff 
4. commit 
5. add commit message 
6. :wq 
7. push 
8. check in the github whether it worked or not 

Getting the most recent version of the repo:
git fetch origin
git status
git pull

OR
If you don't care about any local changes (including untracked or generated files or subrepositories which just happen to be here) and just want a copy from the repo:
git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -xffd
git pull
